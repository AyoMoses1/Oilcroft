        title: "Predictive Asset Life Extension (Pale) Tool",
        content: "Most oil and gas facilities have exceeded their design life. The approach to life extension varies from operator to operator. Some may consider reactive inspection / maintenance and others may aggregate all the reported issues into a project. In either case, it is never possible for the operator to; Scientifically guarantee that the asset life has been extended for ‘X’ years, Guarantee that all ‘hidden’ threats have been identified & mitigated, Provide real-time monitoring data to assure that the projected life extension is on track ; The tendency is for operators to focus on the ‘big-ticket issues while ignoring the more dangerous and ‘out of sight’ integrity threats that result in catastrophic failures. ; With our PALE solution, once implemented: Guaranteed that any reactive maintenance will be near zero, Clarity on how much life extension is achieved / realized with ‘X’ usd spent will be known. You will also have the required data to assure yourself and regulators of the integrity status of the facility. ; Features; Interactive 3D model of the facility, Artificial Intelligence programming, Synchronized corrosion & process model of the facility, Inspection / degradation data review and integration, Field / Facility changes (past, present, future), Smart Integrity Operating Window (IOW) definition, Softwares: CorrIManager & IFM Deployment, Phased project plan with risk ranked execution scope / timelines",

        title: "Chemical Injection Skid Optimizer (CISO)",
        content: "Chemical Injection skids are critical systems in a facility as they are required for both asset integrity and production reliability purposes. Chemical injection skids may be installed for corrosion inhibition, biocide injection etc . Inspite of its importance, operators usually find it hard to answer the following questions; Is the injection skid functioning optimally? Is an Injection point or hose blocked?, Is the injected chemical effective? Is the valve or pump functioning optimally? Are we over injecting or under injecting? ; Answers to this is currently via manual checks which are laborious & error prone. With CISO, all these questions are answered real time. Process parameters such as the injection rate, discharge pressure etc are also available real-time. Manual activities regarding injection skids is reduced by 70% while chemical availability can be increased to 99%, ultimately translating to significant cost savings.; Features; 3D replica of the chemical injection skid, Installed sensors – vibration, flow rate, level, pH, etc, Intelligent data analysis via AI(Projects stock replenishment date, Predicts pump failure or hose blockage etc), Remote access & control (optional) on phone/tablet/laptop, Evaluates chemical effectiveness.",

        title: "Advanced Water Oxidizer (AWO)",
        content: " Oftentimes bacteria infested produced water or drain water in transported via pipelines (reduced pipeline integrity) and discharged to the environment outside the acceptable specification (fines & reputational damage) leading to polluted fresh water bodies which impacts healthof the locals (court cases, deaths & punitive claims). The AWO treats effluents, produced water, polluted river water into POTABLE water via a low energy plasma which oxidises hydrocarbons, bacteria, resin, acids, phenols and over 60 other chemial pollutants leaving clean water. The AWO can be deployed as follows; Dispose produced water from assets to environment to DPR specification, Produce potable water for operations at a lower cost , reduced logistics, Eliminate need for biocide during water injection, Provide potable water from polluted streams to communities in the Niger Delta.; Features: No moving parts, low maintenance, No chemicals or UV required, Compact and energy efficient, Smallest unit provides water for 2300 homes or 1800 vessel ballast.",
